- 👩‍💻 I am interested in the intersection between technology and human health. That being said, I also care a lot about education, music, and sports!
- 📈 I love using data to tell stories, make better decisions, model complex systems, analyze behavior, and solve problems.
- 🔜 In Spring 2021, I will be co-teaching a course called Data Science for Biotech in the Tufts Experimental College.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I memorized 314 digits of pi in 6th grade... and still remember them... because I am a huge nerd. 🤓
